Extends `eslint-config-airbnb-base`.
Use it as a foundation for your own config.

To see the rules that this config uses, please read the detail of our [config rules](https://github.com/75team/eslint-config-75team/blob/master/index.js).

## Installation

``` bash
npm install eslint eslint-config-75team --save-dev
```

## Usage

Once you installed `eslint-config-75team` locally within you project, just set you eslint config to :

``` json
{
    "extends":  "eslint-config-75team"
}
```
Since we have extended `'stylelint-config-standard'`, you don't need to install the standard extends again.

## How the customize your own rules

Simply add a "rules" key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

For example, if you want the max param number in a function to be 6, just add `'max-params': ['error', 6],` to rules

``` json
{
    "extends":  "eslint-config-75team",
    "rules": {
        "max-params": ["error", 5]
    }
}
```

If you need furthor information about customizing rules, you can read [configuration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) and [rules of eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/)

## Use in IDE

1. **[eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)**: Integrates ESLint into VS Code.
